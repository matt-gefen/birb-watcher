# Birb Watchers! Unite!
## Background
Welcome to Birb Watcher, a personal bird watching log that allows birders to record sightings of birds and store them in the cloud!  
In addition to storing/editing your own dated bird sightings and notes, Birb Watcher allows you to:
- View Bird Taxonomy and Species Summary details sourced from ebird.org from your own sightings or from the main directory
- View the sightings of fellow birders and look at details of their birds

This application was a labor of love for birds and served as a learning experience in building MEN Stack CRUD applications.

I hope you enjoy it! I would also recommend using the [Merlin Bird ID Application](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) (Produced by Cornell Labs with EBird) for serious birding 

Get outside and let the rest of us know what you find!
